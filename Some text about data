Santa Fe laser data set. A clean physics laboratory experiment. 1000 points of the fluctuations in a far-infrared laser, approximately described by three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

Pima Indians data set. This data set contains 768 records of female Pima Indians. Each record contains 8 numerical attributes partially describing a patient's medical history. (Notice that is stilled considered quite a challenge on which even state of the art neural techniques misclassify about one fourth of the population. So the best classificion rate will be 76-78%... Don't expect to do better! Compare also a linear classification with a non-linear one.)

BUPA Liver Disorders data set was created by BUPA Medical Research Ltd. The first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption. The 6th variable is the alcohol consumption per day in number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day. Each line in the bupa file constitutes the record of a single male individual. The target concept was defined using the 7th column: Class "1" is used for individuals with a normal liver (145 cases), Class "2" for individuals with a severe liver disorder (200 cases).
